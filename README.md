# Pokedex App

This is a project that shows the names, ids and images of some pokemons, that can be changed by clicking a button. This effect was made by usign the Array.slice function, which allowed me to cut some items from an array of pokemon and that couldn't change those items with a basic counter made with `useState`.

This project was created with `create-react-app` and it fetches data from <a target="_blank" href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a>. It also has a little animation which was gotten from <a target="_blank" href="https://animate.style/">Animate.css</a>.
